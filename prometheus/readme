Steps to test frameworks

Set up kubernetes (minikube/gke)
I guess gke requires some more setup then minikube to run

install prometheus and grafana

for each framework
    Install framework
    Setup so prometheus can scrape the pods

    for each test function (repet x times?)
        run load generator (hey) (retrive call duration, cold start)
        notate down start and stop time 

    export (cpu, memory, number of pods (see autoscaling)) from grafana csv data files

    plot in matlab and save to figure
    use start and stop time to extract correct utilization from csv file
